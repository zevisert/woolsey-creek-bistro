# The Woolsey - DINING SIDE

## APPETIZERS and MAIN COURSES

We are excited to offer a casual menu in appreciation of all the support received
from locals over the years, but we also want to continue to offer a dining experience
that The Woolsey has become known for.

Until November 3, 2024, we are offering our guests the choice of two rotating
appetisers and main course menu items. There will always be a vegetarian main and
appetizer option along with an appetizer and main option that contain meat. These
Fall features will be highlighting what our chefs are testing for our Winter menu
items.

Please ask your server for details and suggested wine pairings.
